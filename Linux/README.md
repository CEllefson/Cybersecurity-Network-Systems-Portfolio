#  About

This folder within the directory is based on the Linux Essentials course hosted by Cisco and taught through the CS-1140 class at Hocking College. These lists are not all encompassing and are likely missing many useful commands. They will be updated over time as new useful information is learned. If you are reading this enjoy and I hope this helps!

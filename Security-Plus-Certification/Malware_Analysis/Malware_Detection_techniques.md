Luckily for us there are ways we are able to detect malware on our computers and networks along with ways to help prevent their access to our computers. Typically a layered and thorough approach will prevent malware from gaining access to your endpoints, except when people get phished.

One such technique is IoA which is Indicator of Attack which is a series of recorded Indicators which flag in the system as abnormal, such as attempted logins after hours, excessive resource consumption, account lockouts, and many other abnormalities. This technique is after an attack has taken place and not necessarily a preventative step but an active monitoring step.

An obvious counter to viruses and other malware is Antivirus software which scans your files for any viruses before you download them, usually newer AV’s use heuristic monitoring rather than the older structure-based monitoring. 

Another layer of security is web browsing protocols such as HTTPS where encryption is added to help prevent attacks that may inject malware using something called TLS or Transport Layer Security. It helps prevent man in the middle attacks from occurring where this malware can be injected as well as providing security to your private information. 

Finally we have an array of monitoring systems that help us track our networks for potential attacks. This first type is the HIDS, which is a Host Intrusion Detection System. Much like the name says, it is an application that runs on the endpoint and has automated detection for any pre-specified flags along with any abnormalities to normal operations. HIDS monitors Inputs and Outputs at the endpoint. HIPS is different as it is the Host Intrusion Prevention System which helps prevent the intrusion along with monitoring. This is also an endpoint application and will often block actions which will weaken system security or allow for an attack. EDR is the Endpoint Detection and Response which is considered stronger than both HIDS and HIPS as it can combine data from multiple endpoints and draw conclusions from these metrics. This helps let the admins know if the attack isn’t limited to one endpoint but rather multiple or the whole network and can help with preventing its spread.

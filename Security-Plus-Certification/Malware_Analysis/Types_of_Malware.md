Malware is any script or program that has a malicious intention or result behind it and it can take many different forms. The first type is Trojans, which is an executable that masquerades as performing a benign activity but does something malicious. These can sometimes be a way for ransomware to take over files. 

Viruses are the next type of malware and are probably one of the most common. Viruses typically infect either a file or can be fileless which is much more dangerous. Viruses append themselves to the end of programs typically to allow themselves better access to the computer to reproduce itself, typically referred to as “jump”ing.

Worms are malware that enter computers through the network and take advantage of vulnerabilities in an application or the OS.The difference between the worm and a virus is that afterwards it is able to jump to another computer in the same network while viruses and trojans usually stay at the same computer.
